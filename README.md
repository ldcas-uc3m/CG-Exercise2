# Project description
Generate a scene containing at least one fractal graphic made with POV-Ray.  

Any of the techniques (or combination of them) that generate fractal elements can be used: language primitives, texture patterns, recursive functions, reflections or infinite repetitions.

# Installation and execution

First install [POV-Ray](https://github.com/POV-Ray/povray/tree/3.7-stable).

For Windows, use the [provided installer](https://www.povray.org/ftp/pub/povray/Official/povwin-3.7-agpl3-setup.exe), and for Linux, you can download it from your preferred package manager.  
For APT:
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install povray
```

To render the file (`src/main.png`), run:
```bash
bash run.sh
```

# Extra information
In order to learn how to use POV-Ray, we recommend to use the [POV-Ray Wiki](https://wiki.povray.org/content/Documentation:Contents), although it's mostly pure documentation.
